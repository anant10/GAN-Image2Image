# Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Implemented [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) and [UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING
WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) to study generative adversarial networks and its usage in data generation.
